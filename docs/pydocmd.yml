# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.

# MkDocs pages configuration. The `<<` operator is sugar added by pydocmd

# in the documentation. The path must be relative to current working directory.
# Put here all md documentation to generate it
